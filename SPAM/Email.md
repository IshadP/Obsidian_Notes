**Subject:** Follow-up on Hackathon Discussion & Sponsorship Request

Dear TCS,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us regarding HackOn. We truly appreciate your support and insights.

We have received the problem statement as well as confirmation of two judges from TCS, and we are grateful for your involvement in making this event a success.

As we move forward with the planning, we would like to formally request TCS to sponsor our event in other ways, such as Monetary Sponsorship, Internship to winners, providing branded goodies, refreshments etc. Your sponsorship would not only enhance the hackathon experience but also provide valuable opportunities for budding innovators.

Please let us know the next steps or any further details required from our end. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
