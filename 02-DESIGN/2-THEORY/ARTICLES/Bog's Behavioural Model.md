# Introduction
Fogg's discovered that **B = MAP** is true for any task a person needs to do.
It explains the relationship between **Motivation** & **Ability to do work** for person and how it relates to task getting completed.

For **B=MAP**, M = Motivation, A = Ability, P = Prompt

According to Foggs, three things can be inferenced from B=MAP,
1. The more motivated a person is, more likely he is to do work
2. Harder the task, less likely for a person to do.
3. Motivation & Ability work like team mates.
