# What is it?
**Compeitive analysis** is the early stage ux process in which compeititors are evaluated in order to provide unqiue usp.
As compeititors can change their offering and are versatile, this process must be iterative and continue as long as project lasts.

It answers 3 basic questions:
1. What are others doing right?
2. What are others doing wrong?
3. Why will people choose you?

# Considerations for compeitive analysis:
1. Create a short list of criteria to evaluate each company.
2. Add your own product to criteria for better comparison'
3. Understand when to stop.
	1. 3-5 compeititors are enough
4. Get inspired, instead of copying from compeititors.
