Powerful product teams are capable of solving complex problems, but how to which problems to solve?

This is answered by Product Strategy

Modern product teams are becomeing a feature pumping teams, rather than solving a existing problems

This causes two major setbacks:
1. High wastage of efforts
2. Brain power is wasted, not utilised to meet company needs


# Strategy is overall approach, a rational one
It doesn't cover tactics to reach the goal.

A good way to define product strategy is:
_How can we make product vision a reality, while meeting the need of company?_

It helps us to decide which problems to solve!

# These make product strategy hard
1. Willingness to make tough chocies and set priorities
2. Generating and identifying insights
3. Insights -> action
4. Avoid micro-management

#### Product strategy starts with focus but depends on insights

As product teams pursue their objectives, some make more progress than others, some need help or encounter major obstacles, some find they need to collaborate with other teams, some realize theyâ€™re missing key capabilities, or any of a hundred other possible situations.
