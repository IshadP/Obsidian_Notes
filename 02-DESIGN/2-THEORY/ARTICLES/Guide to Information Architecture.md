# Value of IA
## Value for users:
→ As the attention span of people keep on decreasing, people will spend less and less time on websites and apps before quiting.
→ For your design to succeed, people should be able to find what they need at right place in right amount of time.
→The 4 main types of user needs from IA are:
	1. Known-item seeking
	2. Exploratory seeking
	3. Exhaustive seeking
	4. Re-finding
→ The faster the user gets to the destination, even if it contains more options, more optimal the experience.
## Value for buisness:
→ Employee productivity is reduced due to bad internal IA.
→ If customer can not find what they need quickly, sales of buisness will go down obviously. People usually abandon the website and find a compeititor.
→ If the above happens, marketing costs will go up, thus IA reduces marketing cost.
→ IA greatly impacts SEO, optimising content of website, provides significant boost to traffic as well as conversions.
→ It reduces cost of help to user as everthing is clear and concise.

## 2. Define User goals:
- Understand users , what are they going to do on website and what are their goals.
- Find the best and worst case scenario.
## 3. Analyse Compeititors:
- Understand their information architecture.
- What makes their website good or bad?
- What is common denominator of information?
## 4. Define Content
- If website already has content, review it and decide what to keep and what to get rid of.
	- Full inventory: you can note all options present to you in the content.
	- Partial Inventory: only note most important assests
	- Content Audit: Quicker and simpler, we determine how useful and effective content is?

# How to design IA?
## Group and label the content
- Use techniques like card sorting and other grouping techniques to acheive this!
## Define Navigation & Create site map
- Now that you have grps that make sense, you need a sitemap and a IA.
- IA is represented as a diagram on sheets, which is then called a sitemap.
- Once you have a good sitemap, you can create good navigation to complement your IA.
## User Testing
- Test early and test often.
- There are mainly four methods of testing;
	1. Tree testing: Participants navigate website using only links to see that all content is accessible by IA.
	2. Close card sorting:
	3. Click testing: Quantitative test tells us about how users use avaliable UI components.
	4. Usablity tests: It is a qualitative testing technique. It reveals patterns about how real users find information on websites and what they use, ignore and refuse to use.
