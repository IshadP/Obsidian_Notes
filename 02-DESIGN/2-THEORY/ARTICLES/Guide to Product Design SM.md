## What is product design?
It is a process of identifying a market opportunity, defining a problem, developing a solution for it, and validating it with users.

> "Design thinking is the human centered approached to innovation, that helps designer to integrate needs of people, with current technological possibilities and the buisness requirement"

-> When designing a product, designers should understand these questions:
1. *What is the problem we are solving?*
2. *Who has this problem?*
3. *What do we want to acheive*

-> Finding solution to any problem includes five phases: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.

## Design Process
It is a series of steps followed by product team to build product from start to finish

-> While it is impossible to define a one-fit-all process, most process generally follow the below steps.
1. Defining product vision
2. Product Research
3. User Analysis
4. Ideation
5. Design
6. Testing & Validation
7. Maintanence

### Define product vision & strategy
[[Product Vision]] is the final destination we need to reach. While [[Product Strategy]] is the methond to reach it. 
- Product vision helps you to understand what you are building, and keeps everyone on the same page so that everyone understands "what is the product and why are we building it"

 > [!quote] Japanese Proverb
> Vision without action is daydream, Action without vision is nightmare 

- [[Product Vision]] acts a guiding light, indicating the direction
- It helps us to set clear boundaries about what is in scope and out of scope!
- [[Product Strategy]] is the route by which you can build exactly what you want!

#### Define value proposition
It maps out key aspects of the product, who is it for, what is it and where it will be used. 
-> One way to define a good vision is __Working backwards__ -> product team work backwards from target users to get minimum set of requirements to satisfy the needs. One potential way is to make a **press release** of the product you are going to make and take feedback on it.
#### Define a success criteria
It is essential to have clear goal for product. If you don't know at the beginning of the project what the end goal looks like you may wander of the track. Metric are used to measure success of the process, things such as KPIs, sales indicate success of the product.

## Product Research
Product research helps to complex product decision based on customer data and market reseearch. Good research informs your product + Solid research helps you sell the idea to stakeholders.

### Conduct user research
As a product creators, our responsibility lies with user, who wil want to create a product that nobody wants!

> Good user research is key to design great user experiences

#### User Interviews
Gathering user info by talking to the person is a well known user research technic. This technique helps the researcher assess user needs and feelings. It typically lasts 30mins to 1 hour. After the interview are done, it's important to synthesize the data.

> [!dtip] Tips
> 1. Try to conduct user interviews in person
> 2. Plan your questions
> 3. Find a experienced interviewer

#### Online Surveys
Surveys provide designers with a large sample of responses to analyse and infer solutions. While it quatitative method in nature, it can be used as qualitative method by asking open ended questions!

> [!dtip] Tips
> 1. Keep it short
> 2. Balance between open-ended and close-ended questions

#### Contextual inquiry
It is a type of method in which users are observed in their natural enviorment. Intially, some questions are asked, then they are observed and questioned while they work in their own enviorment.

> [!dtip] Tips
> 1. Don't just listen to user; observe their behavior
> 2. Minimise interference

### Conduct Market Research
It helps you to asses who your compeititors are, and how are they performing in market, what are their features etc.

#### Compeitive Research
It is a comprehensive analysis of other products and presentation in such way, it compare to our products. Research helps team understand market standards and potential scope for improvement.

_Type of compeititors:_
1. Direct Competitors : whose product compete head to head with your value propositon
2. Indirect Competitors : whose target customer base is same as you but value propostion is different
![[Pasted image 20241105192741.png]]

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Start listing competitors before comp research.
> 2. Use a cloud based tool for competitive research.

## User analysis
The aim of this phase is to capture, organise and making inference about what users want, think or need.

### Modeling the users and their environment
#### Personas
Based on the product research results, users can identify user groups and create representative personas. Personas are ficitional characters created to represent a user type. 
-> The aim of persona is to create a reliable and realistic representation of the key audience segments for reference. 
-> Personas helps product team to understand users' goals and specific context, which is particularly useful during ideation.

![[Pasted image 20241106183141.png]]

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Base of persona is real data
> 2. Avoid using real names or details of research participants or people you know.

#### Empathy Maps
It is a visualisation tool used to articulate what product team knows about user. This tool helps a product team build a broader understanding of 'why' behind user needs and wants. It helps product team focus on people/users.

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Turn your empathy map into a poster

## Ideation
In ideation phaae, team member brainstorm creative ideas to solve the existing customer issues or meet customer needs. 
It not about only generating ideas but also validating them.

### Idea generation based on how users will interact with product
#### User journey mapping
UJ is the process through which any user will accomplish a goal. It is presented in form of steps. 

Simple User Journey :LiArrowBigDown:

Complex User Journey :LiArrowBigDown:

![[Pasted image 20241108141752.png]]

> [!dtips] Tips
> Don't make user journeys too complex, try to keep it simple and linear.

#### Scenarios & StoryBoards
Scenario is how the product fits in dailly life of a persona. While [[User Story]] is visulasizing this scenario as movie or comic. It helps us to determine how users will interact with product on daily basis.

![[Pasted image 20241108142131.png]]

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Build a strong narrative
> ![[Pasted image 20241108142209.png]]
> 2. Design a clear outcome

#### User stories
A user story is simple description of what user wants to perfom or achieve.

![[Pasted image 20241108142317.png]]

### Plan the structure of the product
#### Information Architecture
It is a clear structure of a website, app or product which helps where they are and where the required information is, relative to their position.
It usually is like a tree-hierarchy, resulting in creation of navigation.

-> Involving users in creation of IA, can be beneficial result in more natural and user centric flow. This is usally done by a method called [[Card Sorting]]. This helps you to find where the user intends to find any given information.

>[!ditps] Tips
>Card sorting can be conducted online.

### Generate ideas about how user interface will look
#### Sketching
It is the easiest way to visualise a idea. Drawing by hand is fast way to visualise a concept.

#### Wireframing
It is a visual way to represent page's strucutre important elements and hierarchy. It helps stakeholders understand how the product will look, and help developer to get a idea of what the final product will look like.

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Annotate your Wireframes
> 2. Keep them simple
> 3. Don't use wireframes for testing

### Validate Ideas
#### Design sprints
It is a fixed time framework to validate ideas and put them in front of users to validate hypothesis.
-> Main idea behind design sprint is that the team is picking a idea, designing and rapidly iterating over it.

__During a Design sprint, do not get stuck on first solution.__(usually its not good enough)

## Design
After ideation phase, the product team should have a clear understanding of what they want as a solution. During this phase, the product team will begin to create the solution to solve the client's problems and implement concepts.

### Prototyping
It is a experimental model of the idea, that allows you to test it before, the model is actually implemented. It usually starts small with essential elements, and grows over multiple iterations.

-> Effiiciency is vital to prototying.
-> Protoype range from simple sketched on piece of paper to high fidelity.

#### Paper Prototyping
Paper provides a more accessible way to protoype quicky, with least amount of effort. Sketching allows designers to quickly explore, lot of different designs, and alternatives. Paper prototyping, requires no specific tool.

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Paper prototyping allows for rapid experimentation

#### Digital Prototyping
It is the process of creating an interactive designs with help of online software, which represent a very close to final design, called high fidelity design. 

> [!dtips] Tips
> 1. Avoid dummy text
> 2. Keep your prototype as an up-to-date for developer

## Testing and validation

### Testing with real user
#### Usability Testing
This is the one type of user reseach for your project, it should be qualitative usuability testing. The idea behind usability testing is to test things with real users.

#### Guerrilla Testing
It is to do usuability testing informally, without choosing the target users.
