# Common Button
## Guidelines
-> used to communicate actions users can take
-> too many buttons can disrupt hierarchy
-> Container width should always be set to **dynamically adjust according to text** or should be set **full with centre align** text.
### Anatomy

1. Label
2. Body
3. Icon

-> Label text is most important for the button, **capitalise first word** and use **proper nouns**. Never wrap label text.
