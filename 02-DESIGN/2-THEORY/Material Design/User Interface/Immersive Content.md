# Takeaway
---
-> Provide intuitive way for users to display UI
-> Never permanently hide system bars on personal device. Design accordingly
-> Provide a overlay or scrim for overlying text and controls
-> Combine immersive mode with different pictures such as PiP and chromecast
-> Use it to only benefit user experience
-> consider helping in accidental touch ro frequent taps![[Pasted image 20241227144333.png]]
