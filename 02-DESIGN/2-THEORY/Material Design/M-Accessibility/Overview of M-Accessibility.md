## Principles
- Understanding producct accessibiity can increase usuability for all users.

### Honor indiviuals

Default experience rarely meet everyone's needs. By introducing customisable feature we are expanding room for _indiviual adaptation_, honoring shifting needs of each person. This is due to fact that people experiences can change throught out the life, meeting their expectation while allowing change is need of each individual.

### Learn Before, not after

Before defining a concrete solution learn about user needs with formal and informal research methods. This is open new ways of thinking helping to make product more accessible to each indiviual. A accessible design anticipate as many potentail product outcomes as possible. When a problem does arise, explorin the unanticipate problem can become research foundation.

### Requirement as starting point

The minimum requirement are defined by #WCAG to support specific human needs. Designing with WCAG standards is a creative opportunity to expand and improve the application of requirements that improve human relationships with technology. History shows that features addressing specific human needs are result of creative problem solving within constraints.
