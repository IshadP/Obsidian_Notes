## Brainstrom
-> The first stage of the product development life cycle is the **brainstorm** stage, when the team starts thinking of an idea for a product
	-> You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your competitors and your users helps determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.

## Define
-> The goal is to figure out the specifications for the product by answering questions like: Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful?

## Design
-> At this stage, UX designers develop the ideas for the product. Generally, UX designers start by drawing wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early models of a product that convey its functionality.

## Test
-> UX designers work with engineers to develop functional prototypes that match the original designs, including details and features that fit the company’s brand, like font and color choices. This also means writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product.
-> **Internal tests** within your company, **reviews** with stakeholders, and **external tests** with potential users


# Characteristics of good user experience
## Usable
-> If a product is **usable**, it means the design, structure, and purpose of the product is clear and easy to use

# Equitable
-> If a product is **equitable**, it means a design is helpful to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds.

## Enjoyable
-> If a product is **enjoyable**, it means the design delights the user. The design reflects what the user may be thinking or feeling and creates a positive connection with them.

## Usefulness
-> If a product is **useful**, that means it solves user problems. In other words, the design intentionally solves a user problem that the designer has identified.
