Q. What is design for you? What are 3 reasons why you want to become a designer? What are some products or services you consider to be well designed, and why?

-> Design is a process to help a product better serve its purpose, modify a product to better serve its purpose.

I want to be designer because:
1. curiosity of how things are made to be so easy to use
2. I am inspired by great designed products
3. Design helps people

Spotify, Apple, IKEA.


Q. What are your top 3 questions and uncertainties at this point in your career?

1. How can move past this "self taught" stage to a full on designer?
2. How does design process actually look like in detail?
3. What is my own design process that is suited to me & how do I find it?

Q. What impact do you want the products you design to have on the world around you? What are some behaviours you want your product to enable â€” on the individuals who use the product, in your community, or in society at large?

-> A product developed by me should be sustainable but able to serve its purpose all round, so it can help people tackle a problem which they are facing without it.
