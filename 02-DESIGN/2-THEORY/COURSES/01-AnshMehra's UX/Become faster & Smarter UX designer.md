## Most of us ask wrong question

-> There might be lots of topic that you won't discover until you search for it
-> It's our responsibilty to leverage internet
-> Try looking at bigger picture and not drown in emotion. This will help you recover quickly from low state to high state.
-> When you ask someone a question, ask specifically, this will help them answer it better

 > [!tip] Tip
 > Instead of focusing goals, focus on mindset, approach & process

### Focus on building a brand!

__Do everything but not all at once__
