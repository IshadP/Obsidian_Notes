**The process of understanding user behaviors, needs, and attitudes using different observation and feedback collection methods**

- It helps us to overcome biases since we are going to design app for people not for us!

# Five step path to UR:
1. ==Objectives==: what are knowledge gaps we need to fill?
2. ==Hypothesis==: what do we understand about our user?
3. ==Methods==: what kind of methods to research as feasible to us?
4. ==Conduct==: gather data
5. ==Synthecise==: prove/disprove your hypothesis and fill the knowledge gaps

# UR and Design process:
→ It shows use how our users interact with current product, what are their pain points and how do they feel when they use our product!


# Value of UR:
## Product Benefits:
It provide a clearer view on the main problem the product is solving, thus helping us improve the product!
## Business Benefits:
UR provides us with clearer vision, helping us understand the user thus speeding up development of impactful products.
## User Benefits:
Simply speaking, it is most unfiltered feedback one can get from user!

# Method of UR:
## User groups:
also called ‘focus groups’ these provide quick and concise / accurate feedback of what user wants, feel and pains of user.
They are good when company need lot of insight within a short span of time.
### Why do we conduct User groups:
1. To find what users think of product
2. To find what users think is main purpose of product
3. Where does the product fail

### Best Practices:
1. Make sure you ask well structed open ended questions
2. Keep the sessions small
3. Include 3-5 topics
4. Include 3-6 users

> [!note] How to conduct User Group Study
> Conducting user groups can be broken down into a few major steps:
> 1. Create a schedule that provides enough time for recruiting, testing, analyzing, and integrating results.
> 2. Assemble your team, and establish roles: choose a moderator, note-taker, and discussion leader
> 3. Define the scope of your research: what questions will you ask? And how in-depth do you want to explore the answers? This will determine the number of people and the number of groups that need to be tested.
> 4. Create a discussion guide that includes 3-5 topics for discussion.
> 5. Recruit potential or existing users who are likely to provide good feedback.
> 6. Conduct user group testing, and record data.
> 7. Analyze and report findings.


## Usuability Testing:
Evaluating a product according to its usuage by representative user.

### Why usability testing?
They help you identify problems in user experience quickly and accurately.
It directly tells how much user is satisfies.
It indicates how you can increase product satisfactions and user performance.
It is qualitative, therefor not represent real scenrio 100% but can be high accurate to find mistakes and optimisations.

### Best Practices:
1. Testing with averge 5 users.
2. Invite people who are responsible with how fast or how well problems are addresses (teams)
3. Keep finding breif and simple

> Usability testing can be broken down into a few major steps:
> 1. dentify what needs to be tested and why (e.g. a new product, feature, etc.)
> 2. Identify the target audience (or your desired customers).
> 3. Create a list of tasks for the participants to work through.
> 4. Involve the right stakeholders.
> 5. Apply what you learn.

## User Interviews:
Interview is a method to discover attitudes, belief and experiences of a user.
Usually lasts for an hour or half!\
### Why to we conduct user interviews:
1. One to one nature of interviews help misunderstanding to be addressed directly.
2. Allows you to capture verbal and non verbal cues.
3. Sample size should be decent to get a good idea.
4. Requires multiple people conducting interview.

### Best Practices:
1. **Hire a skilled interviewer**
2. **Create a discussion guide** 
3. **Get informed consent**

[[User Interviews]] 
## Online Surveys:
It is a research tool that is used to find preferences, attitudes and opinions of your users on a given topic.
It includes a set of questions to be answered by masses in order to provide a general analysis of data.
- Use opened question, without asking a leading questions.
- Ex: “What do you dislike about Uber“ → “Whats your experience in getting around town!”

### Why do we conduct online surveys:
Unlike old surveys, Online surveys let companies collect data online quickly and at a exceptionally low price. Survey also help discover general trends of target users etc.
Survey are two edged sword, if used correctly can be a great asset to a project, but these can be plagued by poorly worded questions and negatively influence users answes.
Its important to create short surveys so more users take the survey.

### Best practices:
1. **Keep it short:** Keep your survey, short and simple.
2. **Keep it simple:** make sure questions are easy to grasp and not much technical jargon should be included.
3. **Keep it engaging:** Include a mix of multi choice quesitons and text based questions.

## User Personas:
It is a ficitionals represenatation of our ideal customer who will be using the product.

### Why we create user personas?
Designer needs to understand who is going to use the product, in ordre to make product more impacting and useful.
Well defined personas will help you to identify and develop successful product.
Creating personas can be significant investment and it depends on how deep your knowledge for user is!

### Best Practices:
1. Create a well defined persona:
2. Keep personas brief and to the point.
3. Make personas as close reality as possbile and specific.

# Behavioral vs Attitudinal
its same as what people do vs what people say, Usability testing is a behavioural method while, others are attitudinal


# Qualitative vs Quantitative
### Quantitative
gathers data that is measureable. It provide a clear figure and provide a clear numerical/satisfiable metric to work with.

### Qualitative
gather data about motivation and reasons behind actions. This kind of data is more descriptive and open ended and at times more valuable.
