## What are company goals?
Each company has mainly 3 goals:

__Goals can keep changing__ 

How to measure -> what is impact for us?

Make sure to understand the KPI better by breaking it down into smaller KPI's.
_Ask Why?_

![[Pasted image 20241030141819.png]]

Communicate similar way. start with problem faced by people and then explain solutions that you did to tackle it.

### Uber

Rider or driver cancels is secondaty KPI

Two different team work on both.


### Traderepublic
