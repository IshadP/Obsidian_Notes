## Visibility of System Status:
→ Any design should keep users informed of what is going on, through appropriate feedback in reasonable time.
	 - keeping users informered helps users to attach the strings between interactions, such as click the yellow buttons leads to Task A.
	 - It also helps user guide through a process.
- Tips:
1. Communicate clearly and keep in mind the [[Fitt's Law]].
2. The feedback should arrive fast

## Match real world and system:
→ Use real world conventions for the phrases and names, instead of internal jargon. Ex: instead of showcaseing color as deep cross purple or #1123Ef you can just call it purple.
	- Design with user in mind. Terms and concepts should be understood by user not by developers or designers.
	- It makes user remember the interface better.
- Tips:
1. Never assume what you understand will be understood by user
2. Make sure user never has to look up for word’s defination.

## User control and Freedom:
→ User may perform wrong actions from time to time, make sure you provide a way to have a ‘exit’ from the wrong action. This gives user power and helps them understand what should not be done, without going through the extended process.
	- When it’s easy to `Undo` a action , people feel the freedom and powerful
	- `Exits` allow user to stay in control and keep system robust.
- Tips:
1. Support `Undo` and `Redo`
2. Show clear way to exit the current interaction, like a `Cancel Button`.
3. Make sure exit is clearly labelled

## Consistency and Standard:
→ User should not wonder whether a certain reaction will do something else or not. All design’ should follow [[Jacob's Law]].
	 - Failing to maintain consistency can cause immense congnitive load.
- Tips: 
1. Improve learnability by maintaining consistency both internally and externally.
2. Maintain consistency with single product

## Error Prevention:
→ A good design indicates errors clearly. A *great* design prevents errors from occuring in first place or ask for confirmation before performing the action.
	- Errors occurs due to slips and mistakes
	- Slips: occur unintentionally due to inattention
	- Mistakes: occur consiously based on mismatch of info
- Tips:
1. Priortise high cost erros first.
2. Avoid slips by providing context and good defaults.
3. Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens and warning.

## Reduce memorisation
→ Make everything visible to user. use should not have to memorise parts of interface when transitioning from one part ot another. 
	- Information used by design should be visible and/or easy to retrieve.
	- Interface should always reduce congitive load of remembering things.
- Tips:
1. Let people recognise rather than recall.
2. Offer to help, rather than giving long tutorial
3. Reduce info users have to remember

## Flexibility and Efficieny:
→ Flexible interface let expert users use shortcuts, while novice once go the long path. This allows software to cater for both kind of users.
Allow shortcuts for frequent actions.
- Tips:
1. Provide things like keyboard shortcuts
2. Provide customisation by tailoring content.
3. Allow customisation, by letting users select what they want.

## Aethetics and Minimalism:
→ Interface should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. As any piece of info competes with all other info for attention.
	- make sure your design is not flat, but contains mostly essentials.
	- Ensure UI supports user’s final goals.
- Tips:
1. Keep UI and content focused on essentials.
2. Don’t let unnecessary info distract user from their goal
3. Priortise content that supports primary goal.

## Help users recongnise and diagonse errors:
→ Error message should be expressed in plain text, and should suggest a constructive solution.
- Tips:
1. use traditional error message visual, bold & red.
2. Avoid technical jargon
3. Be expersive about error
4. offer common solution to the problem
