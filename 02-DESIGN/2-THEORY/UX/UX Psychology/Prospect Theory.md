## What is it?
It explains how people choose different options & how they determine percieved likelihood of each option
Usually humans tend to overestimate the likelihood of occurence of a less probablity event which can result in a loss.

### Experiment:
Lets play a game, You have $1000 in your pocket, you can do two things
1. have a 90% to double the money or 10% to half it.
2. get 1.5X of whatever you have

â†’ Usually most people will choose option 2 as it provides a safer bet.

> [!NOTE] RISK
> People tend to avoid options that posses some kind of risk, and can result in loss.

## Biases
Prospect theory explains baises that people use when they make such decisions:
1. Certainity
2. Isolation Effect
3. Loss Aversion

### Certainity:
People would rather get a smaller but certain reward than the ability to get a larger but risky reward.
This explains why customers remain loyal to one brand, even though other brand may be providing better services.

### Isolation Effect:
People like to focus on differentiators rather than common things.
To make your product seem more better, a side-by-side list of the differentiators provides a better context.

### Loss Aversion:
Losses loom larger than gains. If you win $100 and lose $80, it will still be considered a overall loss even though you made $20.


## Users:
1. We react more strongly to moments of loss. Therefor it is important that we test everything and work hard to fix small barriers that users may come across.
2. We are designing for people who are hard to please.
