Assumptions- a double edged sword

Assumption are thing we consider to be true or false without fact checking. Whenever I start with a new project, a new flow or even a new screen, sometimes my brain has already sketched it. This is pure hypothesis based on previous experience. a assumption of what should be. This might make the process faster or make it slower. Assumptions can make or break your design, there for it is necessary to verify them as soon as possible. one way I do it to bring assumption into reality real quick, which helps clear my brain space. I can ofc iterate on it later. this is usually first part of my process. after research revisiting these crude works can help to get to final result. if you assumpiton is wrong, it eliminate a big liability in design. ofc you can assume things, but validating those assumptions is also very important

**Assume: Should we or should we not?**

Every time I start a new project, new user flow, new feature, or even just a single screen something interesting happens: my brain sketches it before I even touch a tool. 

These sketches aren’t from research, data, or user feedback. They’re assumptions  shaped by past experiences, similar problems I’ve solved, and patterns I've seen. Sometimes, these assumptions help me move faster. Other times, they slow me down. But either way, I’ve learned not to ignore them.

Assumptions can either accelerate your design process or completely derail it. That’s why, over time, we have **pull them out of my head and into reality**  quickly. A rough wireframe, a dirty draft, a quick mockup is usually enough to externalize what we are thinking. Not to validate it yet, just to free up mental space and make room for clarity.

Once research is complete, we can revisit those early artifacts. They might turn out to be totally off  and that’s a good thing. It means we dodged a big design liability early. Or sometimes, they serve as a strong starting point that just needed better grounding.

Validating assumption faster helps me create better design. Let me know your thought on assumptions and what value they provide in your process?
