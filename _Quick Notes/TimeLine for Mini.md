1. **Week 1: Learning Basics**
    
    - **Day 1-2**: Study how Telegram bots work.
        - Learn Telegram Bot API (using Python libraries like `python-telegram-bot`).
        - Create a simple bot that reads messages from a group and replies.
    - **Day 3-4**: Research spam detection, fake news detection, and malicious link analysis techniques.
    - **Day 5-6**: Learn about datasets for spam and fake news detection.
        - Spam Detection: SMS Spam Collection, Email Spam Datasets.
        - Fake News: LIAR Dataset, Fake News Corpus.
        - Malicious Links: Understand Google Safe Browsing API.
    - **Day 7**: Document the learning process and finalize tools and libraries to use (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, Transformers).
2. **Week 2: Setting Up the Environment and Dataset Collection**
    
    - **Day 1-2**:
        - Install necessary tools: Python, relevant libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `transformers`, etc.).
        - Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
    - **Day 3-5**: Preprocess datasets for spam and fake news detection:
        - Clean, tokenize, and structure data for training.
    - **Day 6-7**:
        - Explore Google Safe Browsing API and learn how to extract and validate URLs using regex.

**Deliverables for Phase 1**:

- Working prototype of a basic Telegram bot.
- Preprocessed datasets for spam and fake news detection.
- Project setup and documentation of research.

### **Phase 2: Spam Detection (Week 3-4)**

**Objective**: Develop, test, and refine a spam detection module.

1. **Week 3: Building the Model**
    
    - **Day 1-3**:
        - Train a simple spam detection model using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes.
        - Evaluate on validation data for baseline performance.
    - **Day 4-5**:
        - Experiment with advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to improve accuracy.
        - Optimize hyperparameters for performance.
    - **Day 6-7**: Integrate the spam detection model into the Telegram bot.
        - Add functionality to read group messages and classify spam.
2. **Week 4: Testing and Refining the Spam Detection Module**
    
    - **Day 1-2**: Test the bot in real groups to identify false positives/negatives.
    - **Day 3-4**: Optimize the model thresholds to reduce errors.
    - **Day 5-6**:
        - Improve response times for real-time message handling.
        - Add logging for flagged spam messages.
    - **Day 7**: Document the spam detection module.

**Deliverables for Phase 2**:

- Spam detection module integrated with the bot.
- Documentation of the spam detection workflow.

### **Phase 3: Fake News Detection (Week 5-6)**

**Objective**: Train a fake news detection model and integrate it with the bot.

1. **Week 5: Building the Model**
    
    - **Day 1-3**: Train a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) for fake news detection.
        - Fine-tune on the collected dataset (e.g., LIAR dataset).
    - **Day 4-5**: Evaluate the model and adjust for accuracy.
    - **Day 6-7**: Implement heuristics for cases where the model lacks confidence.
        - For example, flagging suspicious keywords or performing sentiment analysis.
2. **Week 6: Integration and Testing**
    
    - **Day 1-2**: Integrate the fake news detection model into the Telegram bot.
    - **Day 3-4**: Test the feature with real-world data in Telegram groups.
    - **Day 5-6**: Optimize for performance and add fallback responses for ambiguous results.
    - **Day 7**: Document the fake news detection module.

**Deliverables for Phase 3**:

- Fake news detection module integrated into the bot.
- Documentation of the model training and testing process.

### **Phase 4: Malicious Link Detection (Week 7)**

**Objective**: Add malicious link detection using Google Safe Browsing API.

1. **Week 7: Implementation and Testing**
    - **Day 1-2**: Integrate Google Safe Browsing API into the bot.
        - Create a function to validate links extracted from messages.
    - **Day 3-4**: Add warning messages for flagged links (e.g., "Warning: This link may be malicious").
    - **Day 5-6**: Test the link detection module in Telegram groups.
    - **Day 7**: Document the link detection feature and its limitations.
