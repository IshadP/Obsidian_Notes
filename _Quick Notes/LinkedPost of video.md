Adding ability to read your brain without AI in Youtube

Let me introduce you to smart recommendation and filters on Youtube. Youtube is the go to app for videos for all of us, but it seems it loses on many chance to help you find what you need.

From suggestion based on what you type, to reading you brain sometimes, Youtube might be able to do it, All the thorugh the current search experience.

This has been a ambitious project of mine, in works from last month.

I did variation iterations, from changing the location of a text field to adding a new feature. This project sourced lot of debates and many conversations with my peers. And here is what I came up with. The feedback from everyone specially from my mentor, AA, was critical to develop a mature and practical design.

**What if YouTube could actually read your mind?** 

I spent a month redesigning their search experience to make it feel like it does. Youtube is the go-to app for all things video, but we all had that
"Ah this isn't what I searched for moment". So I came up with a solution!

From suggestions based on what you type to moments where it almost feels like itâ€™s reading your mind, I redesigned Youtube's search experience to just do that!

This has been an ambitious project of mine, in the works for the past month.

I tried out tons of variations, from changing how where search results are shown to adding entirely new features. It sparked plenty of debate and led to some deep conversations with peers. The feedback, especially from my mentor AA, played a huge role in shaping the design into something more mature and practical
