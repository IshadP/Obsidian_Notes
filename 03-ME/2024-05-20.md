# Thoughts about today:

Well today was quite a ride tbh. Let's start from morning
Morning was good read 16-18 pages will complete that chapter tomorrow but after that I became lazy and didnt do anything, I need to start gathering my shit up. Cause this laziness is making me feel sick and only way to change it is to work hard. I need to get through a good workout schedule.
Also man, my focus is everywhere I mean really, gotta do something about it gather it up and work hard. Afternoon came around and did a magzine page in 2 hours I mean ya it was difficult but I did it anyways. 
Evening played some games I really should reduce my gaming time

Basically, I need to focus on one task at a time I am literally multitasking so yeah that will be the goal from tmrow.
Let see.
Night was with da bois, roaming and talking, good time but yeah
Lets not think about it too much.
While I think I can take myself on, I keep telling problems to other specially yashasvi and I dont wanna do that anymore, I want to solve my own problems. Gonna work on that as well.

Anyways TTYL!
