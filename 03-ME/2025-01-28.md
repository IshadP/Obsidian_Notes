# About Today:

Its around 10:00PM

and I have no words to express how sad I am feeling. Why you might ask? Here is the context, my little sister asked me to dance with her in cultural fest of our college, and I denyed, she was sad but she accepted it, then for a few days things were okay okay, normal mostly, today she asked in video call for a ramp walk, and I froze, it was a no she knew that. but still she tried and I love her for that. 

Now she is angry and sad due to me ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

I don't know why I don't wanna do it, I just don't its just my internal self saying no.

anyways so she was texting me how it feels and its fine, obliviously very hurting, I know how it feels but is quite hurtful being on the other side, literally my heart sank dk why.

All things were hurtful, but what specially hurt me the most was:

"It will always be fine" - this one sentence hurts more than any physical pain ever could.

idk its just hurts to heart.

Anyways not feeling any good, maybe I am not good enough, very visible, I hope she finds someone to dance and ramp walk with.

Just can't stop thinking about this ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
Days like I really hope I had a person to hug, and here I am bringing sadness to life of a person who cares for me more than anyone.
Feeling like crying anyways

Later ig.
