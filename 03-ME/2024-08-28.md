# Thoughts about today:
So I am looking for some good ideas right. The problem is I am looking not for idea but for person. Yeah, I want to work with someone ik thats the issue. As always feared of exploration. But the best way to tackle is a head on collision. So if I want to lead my team, I need to provide a idea that solves a problem not a just any problem. It solves a viable problem.
Lets see the list of problem I face as of today:
1. Motivation and work ethic
2. A problem with guidance
	Like I really would like a personalised roadmap that provides me with personalised way to build my confidence in a subject or in that matter UX. This roadmap should be accompanied by a mentor.
	__What is problem with current roadmaps?__
	→ Well they overwhelm me mostly. Also they tell me what to do, somtimes when todo and the order, but I would like a more personalised way to get a day to day plan of activites I would like.
3. Study planning is stiill a issue, but following the study plan is a bigger issue. I think this is due to fact that, I am unable to see any incentive in doing thing I don’t like, until it starts to matter….which is when exam is near.
4. Ai is something which helps us and also destroys us at same time.
