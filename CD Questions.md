## Memory allocation for procedure calls and return statements

In compiler design, **memory allocation during procedure call and return** is a fundamental aspect of runtime organization. When a procedure (or function) is called, the compiler must allocate memory for various components such as parameters, local variables, return address, and bookkeeping data. This is typically managed through a **runtime stack**, also known as the **call stack**, which supports a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, suitable for nested and recursive procedure calls.

Each time a procedure is invoked, a data structure called an **activation record** or **stack frame** is pushed onto the stack. The activation record holds several key pieces of information: space for actual parameters (arguments passed to the function), return address (where control should return after the function finishes), control link (a pointer to the calling procedure's activation record), access link (used in languages with nested procedures to access non-local variables), and space for local variables and temporary data. In some cases, a return value field is also included if the procedure is expected to produce a result.

When the procedure is called, the compiler generates code to allocate and initialize this activation record. The parameters are evaluated and placed in the appropriate locations, the return address is stored, and the control jumps to the procedure's code. A **frame pointer** (FP) or **base pointer** is often used to reference the current activation record, while the **stack pointer** (SP) indicates the top of the stack. Together, they help manage and access data within the current procedure.

During execution, the procedure may declare and use local variables, which are stored in the current activation record. If the language supports dynamic memory allocation (like using `malloc` in C), a separate heap segment is used, and pointers to this memory are stored in the stack. Additionally, **recursive calls** result in multiple activation records being pushed, one for each active instance of the procedure.

When a **return statement** is encountered, the procedure finishes its execution. The compiler generates code to copy the return value (if any), restore the caller’s frame and stack pointers, and transfer control back to the return address. The current activation record is then popped from the stack, effectively deallocating memory used by the called procedure.

In the case of **nested procedures** (as seen in languages like Pascal or modern functional languages), the **access link** becomes crucial. It allows the called procedure to reference variables declared in its enclosing scope, even if the call came from a different part of the program. This access link is maintained through static or dynamic links, depending on the implementation of the compiler and the language’s scoping rules.

In summary, memory allocation for procedure call and return in compiler design is centered around the efficient use of a runtime stack and activation records. It ensures proper parameter passing, local variable handling, and return management while supporting recursion and nested scopes. This stack-based memory organization is a cornerstone of most modern language runtimes, enabling clean and organized function call management.

## Give runtime storage managemenr for calls and return statements

In compiler design, **runtime storage management** is a crucial part of implementing procedure or function calls and handling return statements. The compiler, along with the runtime system, must organize memory effectively to store data such as parameters, return addresses, local variables, and intermediate values. This is primarily achieved through a **runtime memory layout**, which includes areas like the **code segment**, **data segment**, **heap**, and most importantly, the **stack**.

For managing function calls and returns, the **stack segment** plays a central role. When a function is called, a new block of memory known as an **activation record** or **stack frame** is created and pushed onto the stack. This record stores critical information required for the function to execute and eventually return. It typically contains the return address (so control can go back after the function ends), parameters passed to the function, space for local variables, and administrative data like the dynamic link (pointing to the caller's frame) and access link (used in languages with nested procedures for referencing non-local variables).

The **stack pointer (SP)** keeps track of the top of the stack, while the **frame pointer (FP)** helps reference fixed locations within the current activation record. These pointers are adjusted as the function executes and cleaned up when the function returns. If the function is recursive, each call generates a new activation record with its own state, allowing multiple independent calls to coexist.

On encountering a **return statement**, the runtime system performs cleanup: it may move the return value into a designated register or memory location, reset the stack and frame pointers, and then use the saved return address to transfer control back to the caller. The stack frame is then popped, effectively deallocating the function’s runtime storage.

In addition to the stack, the **heap segment** is used for dynamic memory allocation, such as allocating memory during execution using constructs like `new` or `malloc`. While heap memory is managed manually or by garbage collectors (in high-level languages), stack memory is automatically managed by the call and return mechanisms.

Thus, runtime storage management for calls and returns ensures correct handling of procedure execution contexts, supports recursion, enables scope-based memory allocation, and contributes to overall program correctness and efficiency. It is a foundational part of the compiler's backend and runtime system design.
